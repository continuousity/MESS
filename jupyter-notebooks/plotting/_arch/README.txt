Figure5-ParameterEstimationCV-dev.ipynb - Notebook for developing cross-
validation and plotting for figure 5. Almost totally re-engineered this
code into the inference.Ensemble.cross_val_* methods, so I rewrote the notebook
to use that functionality, but wanted to keep this intact to refer back to
it if necessary.

pi_dxy_6panel.ipynb - This is actually a copy of an old nb from gimmeSAD
that would plot ABC pods cross-validation on parameters. It was used
for developing figure 5.
